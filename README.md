# **Minigrep: A Simple Command-Line Search Tool**

Minigrep is a basic command-line tool written in Rust that mimics the functionality of `grep`. It allows users to search for a query string within a file or multiple files, with optional case-insensitive searching. This project helps to demonstrate basic file handling and text searching in Rust.

## **Features**
- Search for a query string within a file.
- Case-insensitive search using the `IGNORE_CASE` environment variable.
- Simple CLI interface.
- Unit tests for case-sensitive and case-insensitive search.

## **Installation**

### **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/minigrep.git
